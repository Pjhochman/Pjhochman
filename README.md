### Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

You've found my profile. In short, I'm a Front-End developer from Stockholm, Sweden.

My favorite technologies include but are not limited to: 

<ul>
  <li>React :blue_heart:</li>
  <li>Node :green_heart:</li>
  <li>Cypress :yellow_heart:</li>
</ul>

I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs. When I'm not pushing pixels, you'll find me playing the piano :musical_keyboard:, listening to jazz :saxophone:, blues :guitar:, funk :drum: and enjoying walks with my dog :dog:.

Feel free to <a href="mailto:peter.hochman.dev@gmail.com?">reach out to me</a> for help or collabs.
