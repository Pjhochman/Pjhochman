### Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

You've found my profile. In short, I'm a Front-End developer from Stockholm, Sweden.

I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs. When I'm not pushing pixels, you'll find me playing the piano, listening to jazz, blues, funk and enjoying walks with my dog :dog:.

Feel free to <a href="mailto:peter.hochman.dev@gmail.com?">reach out to me</a> for help or collabs.
